## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Objectives
The primary objective is to verify that the new **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) feature** is functional, secure, and seamlessly integrated into the user login flow on both web and mobile platforms.

### 1.2 Scope
* **In Scope:** 2FA setup (via SMS and Authenticator App), login with 2FA enabled, 'Remember This Device' functionality, 2FA disable/reset process, and error handling for incorrect codes.
* **Out of Scope:** Performance testing under heavy load, security penetration testing beyond standard functional checks.

---

## 2. Test Strategy

The primary strategy will be **risk-based testing**, focusing heavily on security-related negative test cases (e.g., brute-forcing the code, using expired codes) and cross-platform compatibility.

### 2.1 Test Types
* **Functional Testing:** Verification of successful 2FA setup and login flow.
* **Negative Testing:** Attempting to bypass 2FA, using invalid/expired codes.
* **Compatibility Testing:** Ensuring 2FA works correctly on Android, iOS, Windows, and Mac.
* **Regression Testing:** A subset of existing smoke/regression tests will be executed on the core login process to ensure 2FA implementation has not introduced side effects.
